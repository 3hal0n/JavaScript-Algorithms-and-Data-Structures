JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects
This repository contains solutions to the final projects required to complete theâ€¯JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structuresâ€¯certification from freeCodeCamp.org. Each project demonstrates core JavaScript skills such as string manipulation, regular expressions, algorithmic problem solving, and DOM manipulation.
