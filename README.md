# JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Projects

This repository contains solutions to the final projects required to complete the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** certification from [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each project demonstrates core JavaScript skills such as string manipulation, regular expressions, algorithmic problem solving, and DOM manipulation.
